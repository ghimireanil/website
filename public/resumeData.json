    "bio": "I love design and innovation of products that makes peoples life convenient. From my early childhood, I was fascinated by the working mechanism and innovation of technologies like car, airplane and cell phone. Since then, I wanted to be someone who works for the design and innovation of such products. It seemed like an appropriate dream given that I graduated with BE in Mechanical Engineering. I gravitated towards the design, innovation and improvements of products for the welfare of society. I got chance to work on a project with Department of Sanitation New York(DSNY) for the design improvement of trucks interior. Apart from the experience in Engineering, I yearned to learn more, yearned to learn something related to programming to compete in the era of computer technologies. That’s when it happened; the spark got ignited at the instant I learned my first Java tutorial video. Since then, I can’t get enough of learning programming languages. I learnt HTML,CSS, JavaScript and Linux. Web development at all calls to my passion as it incorporates my creativity and problem-solving skills and moreover I’m allowed to break to improve the code. I love applying different design principles and watch my web pages shrink into different devices. I was oddly satisfied when I published my first web page, but I still keep my creativity flash intact. My specialties include problem solving, responsive design principles, result oriented and quickly learning new skills and programming language. Till now, I have learnt C++, MATLAB, Java, JavaScript, React, Node, Express, SQL, MongoDB, HTML, CSS and AWS. I’m enthusiastically learning other programming languages and principles that I can incorporate in future.",
